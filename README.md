<h2>An Indeed Scraper Using:</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>Bright Data:</b> to not get blocked by indeed. You will need to make an account, can use the $5 free they provide.</p>
<p><b>Pyppeteer:</b> puppeteer but python.</p>
<p><b>Pandas:</b> to store all the data.</p>
<p><b>Regex:</b> to filter the data we are craping.</p>
<p><b>BeatifulSoup:</b> to scrape all the data.</p>
<p><b>Asyncio:</b> to be able to run it all without problems.</p>
</ul>

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p> It works perfectly fine even if it can be slow because of the way it works. It opens up all the job posts one by one to get the full job descriptions. There is a room for improvement, will try to make it faster, find a new way of doing it to be more efficient, optimise the code to be smaller as well.</p>
